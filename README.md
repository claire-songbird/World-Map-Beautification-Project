# World-Map-Beautification-Project
Forked from CosmicOdeum's version. Added some other biomes! â™¥
I wasn't sure if they wanted collaboration but I didn't want to wait for them to finish this mod. Even if I just flesh the hills out for *all the biome mods I use* my game will look much better.

## Status?
- Added More Vanilla Biomes (Just hills, no trees yet ;_;)
- Added Alpha Biomes (Some biomes have ugly trees. Wip)
