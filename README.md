# World-Map-Beautification-Project
![Huge Example Image lol like enormous like 4k++](https://github.com/claire-songbird/World-Map-Beautification-Project/blob/main/About/BigShot.jpg?raw=true)
Forked from CosmicOdeum's version. Added some other biomes! â™¥
I wasn't sure if they wanted collaboration but I didn't want to wait for them to finish this mod. Even if I just flesh the hills out for *all the biome mods I use* my game will look much better. Feel free to pull this back into main if you want.

## Status?
- Added **Hills Only** for *More Vanilla Biomes*
- Added **Hills & 50% WIP Trees** for *Alpha Biomes*
- Added **Hills & WIP Trees** for *[HLX] ReGrowth: Vulcanic Ice Sheet* and *[HLX] ReGrowth: Wastelands*
- Added **Hills Only** for *Rainbeau's Realistic Planets - Fan Update*

## Todo?
- LOTR Biomes
- MorroRim Biomes
- Trees for all
- Fix WIP Trees
- Balance rainfall levels/test
